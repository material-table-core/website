# Using with @material-ui v5

The v5 version is always keept on par withthe v4 branch expect thechanges to make v5 workable.


## Breaking Changes

[See here for more](/docs/breaking-changes#material-ui-v5)

## Changes

The table icons are now supplied out-of-the-box, but can still be added to override them.

## Reasoning

With `material-ui` v5 becoming stable with a beta on July 1st and being promoted as the version to use, we starting to support both version v4 and v5.

If you migrated to version 5 of `material-ui`, simply install our prerelease version to access the new version that supports v5.

## Installation

### Yarn

`yarn add @material-table/core@next`

### NPM

`npm install @material-table/core@next`
